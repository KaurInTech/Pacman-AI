# Pac-Man AI

This project implements artificial intelligence algorithms to control the behavior of Pac-Man agents in a game environment. The goal is to develop agents that can navigate the game maze, avoid ghosts, and collect food pellets to score points. The project uses Python as the primary programming language and utilizes various AI techniques such as search algorithms and game heuristics.

## Features

The Pac-Man AI system includes the following features:

- Search algorithms such as Depth-First Search , Breadth-First Search, Uniform-Cost and A* search are implemented to help the agents navigate the maze and find the shortest path to the goal.
- Adversarial search algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax are implemented to allow Pac-Man agents to play against ghost agents controlled by other algorithms or human players.
- Game heuristics are designed and optimized to evaluate the quality of different game states and guide the agents' decision-making process.

## Getting Started

To run the Pac-Man AI system, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.
2. Run the `pacman.py` script to start the game environment.
3. Use the arrow keys to control Pac-Man and observe the behavior of the AI-controlled agents.
